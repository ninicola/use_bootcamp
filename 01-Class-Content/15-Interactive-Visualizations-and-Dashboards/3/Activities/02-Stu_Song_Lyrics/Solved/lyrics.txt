You've been in my dreams
Right there in the seams
In the nooks, in the fabric
And where the day leaves
There's so much I'd like
To share with you
Share my arms
Share my time
Share almost anything that's mine
Except my fear of losing you
Ooh
We could fly to New York
I could show you that place
Cut shapes from the winter's
Most delicate lace
Lay down into
Among crystals of snow
But this is real life
Don't you know?
We could fly to New York
I could show you that place
Cut shapes from the winter's
Most delicate lace
Lay down into
Among crystals of snow
But this is real life
Don't you know?
You're part of me now
Known me somehow
Since birth
Since I fell down
Since you gave me my crown
It's too much to bear
Too much love there
Full of wonder
I will be free again, see almost all of me
But not my fear of losing you, oh
We could fly to New York
I could show you that place
Cut shapes from the winter's
Most delicate lace
Lay down into
Among crystals of snow
But this is real life
Don't you know?
We could fly to New York
I could show you that place
Cut shapes from the winter's
Most delicate lace
Lay down into
Among crystals of snow
But this is real life
Don't you know?
